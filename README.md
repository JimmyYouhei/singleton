# Singleton Design Pattern Implementation

This repository demonstrates the Singleton design pattern in multiple programming languages:

- JavaScript
- Java
- C#
- Python (coming soon)

## What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when you need to control access to a shared resource, such as a database connection, configuration settings, or a logger.

## Why Use the Singleton Pattern?

- **Guaranteed Single Instance:** Ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application's lifetime.
- **Global Access:** Provides a simple and consistent way to access the single instance from anywhere in the code.
- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is created only when it's first needed, saving resources if it's never used.
- **Controlled Access:** You can add logic to the `getInstance` method to control how and when the instance is created.

## How It Works

1. **Private Constructor:** Prevents external code from creating new instances directly.
2. **Static Instance Variable:** Holds the single instance of the class.
3. **Static `getInstance` Method:** Provides a way to access the single instance. If the instance doesn't exist yet, it creates it and then returns it.

## Implementation

Explore the specific language implementations in their respective subdirectories:

- `/javascript`
- `/java`
- `/csharp`
- `/python` (coming soon)

Each subdirectory contains:

- Implementation code file (e.g., `singleton.js`)
- Detailed README explaining the Singleton pattern and its implementation in that language
- Unit tests (if applicable)

## Usage Example

### JavaScript

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const config = Configuration.getInstance();
const databaseUrl = config.getDatabaseUrl();
```
